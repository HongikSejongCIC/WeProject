### Progress  
We want to create a communication system by combining smart phone camera operation code and visible light communication code.
So we will try using open source including CameraFilter and CameraCoder for project execution.
We want to achieve our goal through multiple attempts.
There are many things I do not know yet so I will refer to more open source.
Those codes are probably CameraFilter and CameraCoder and etc.  

### extend  
The project will be modified to get screen data from code that manipulates smartphone cameras.
We will also add code to convert the data we get from the screen into the desired form.
